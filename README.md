<h2> How it Works </h2>
This maze game uses a stack data structure to simulate the movement of a mouse character through a maze. The game board is represented by a 2D array, where '1' indicates walls and '0' represents open spaces. The mouse moves based on user input, and each position is stored on the stack to track its path. If the mouse encounters a dead end, the program pops from the stack to backtrack and find an alternate route. The user can also blow up or add walls and change the maze's colors during the game.
